# Accident Prediction Model with Image Recognition

This repository contains a comparative analysis of accident prediction models using image recognition techniques as well as a corresponding research paper.  The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes images related to accident scenarios. We explore three different models: CNN, KNN, and Random Forest Trees, evaluating their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
